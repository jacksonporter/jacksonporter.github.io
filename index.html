      <b><u>Software Engineer<br>
        </u></b>Technology has been a hobby since I could remember. I am
      curious; I want to know more! I am highly skilled with computers,
      with knowledge in Java, C#, MS SQL, BASH Scripting, MIPS
      architecture and basic Operating Systems knowledge for Windows, OS
      X (Mac) and Linux (specifically Ubuntu based distributions).I am
      currently taking classes towards my Bachelor's Degree in Software
      Engineering through Snow College. I have received two Associate's
      degree from Snow College in 2016 and 2017 in Arts and Science.
      View my highlighted schoolwork in the Software Engineering Page. I
      have worked as an IT Help Desk assistant at Snow College as well
      as operating my own support business in Sanpete County, Utah (<a
        href="http://valleyct.com">http://valleyct.com</a>). <u><b><br>

      <u><b><br>
          Musician<br>
        </b></u>I have loved music since I was a child. I have been
      playing the piano since I was young. I started choir in the 7th
      grade while eventually joining the A Capella and Madrigal choirs
      at Murray High School. I am also a newbie to the composition
      world. I have written multiple songs; one in which I have
      performed at my high school's talent show. I perform, write and
      record my own music. Below is a embedded song from my SoundCloud.

      <u><b>Runner<br>
        </b></u>I love to run. I started my running career with Cross
      Country and Track and Field at Murray High School in 2012.
      Practice is something I look forward to. I was on Murray's Varsity
      Teams and I was a captain.&nbsp; My personal best in the 3 mile to
      date is 17:57. My personal best in the 1 mile is 5:15, and 11:30
      in the two mile.I continue running as I attend Snow College and
      learn more index Software Engineering. I have volunteered and also
      worked as a Track and Field Coach at Manti High School during my
      time at Snow College.<br>
