# Web II Final Project
## Jackson Porter 

### Assingment Description:
Build your own website using the following elements. The web site can contain as many pages as you wish. Take note though your website will be graded partially on appearance so don't cram everything into one web page. 

- CSS style sheets.
- HTML 5 Coding
- Minimum of 3 images per page using any of the following:
    - Background
    - Hyperlinks
    - Logoâ€™s
    - video's 
- At Least 1 Page with HTML tables
- A feedback form (web form)
- Video (can be a homemade or, a still image video(Video's will be of your own making, no links to Youtube or any other source unless you have your own channel on Youtube or any other source and they are video's you have personally created.
- (optional) Audio
- Your choice of GUI or HTML editors (you must put a link somewhere on your pages. [all pages must have the link somewhere I would suggest a logo] to the main web page of the editor you used.)

### Grading Standards
Your site will be graded on Functionality, appearance, W3C standards (code), and whether you have all the elements included.


### Notes
*It is known that the css file: `https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css` does not pass the W3C CSS validator, it is an external library (file) that I don't modify at all.
